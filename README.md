We are creating collaborative, free, open textbooks.

The underlying concept behind these open textbooks is to make Intellectual Property & Technology Law more accessible — both physically and conceptually. Our books aim to be a complete university level textbook to replace expensive and quickly outdated commercial books.

We would love your help writing these books! Please take a look at the individual textbooks for more info on how to contribute.
