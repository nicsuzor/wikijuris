We are writing a collaborative textbook about IP and Internet Law.
- Source code is: ~/src/wikijuris (gh: @nicsuzor/wikijuris)
- Text is Markdown format
- Incoming files are in ./incoming

We need to edit suggestions that come in, convert them to Markdown, ensure they match tone and style and are correct, and place them in the correct place in the book.
