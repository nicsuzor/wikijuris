# Australian IP Law open textbook
{: .no_toc }

1. Table of Contents
{:toc}

This is a collaborative, free open textbook about Australian Intellectual Property Law. The underlying concept behind this open textbook is to make Intellectual Property Law more accessible — both physically and conceptually for students. This book aims to be a complete university level textbook.

You can find our complete course of accompanying IP videos on YouTube: [Australian IP law](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL6gyWv948RU928wTpzqyDBwmIcfy2-Zz).

We also have an open textbook about internet law and regulation: [Governing the Internet](/cyberlaw/)

## Why Open Textbooks?
The textbook market is flawed - students are paying too much, and do not have choice in the books they buy. We are creating a set of open educational resources that are free for the world to use.

**Watch the [introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpDMNZ6DyVQ) to learn more about what we're doing.**

## How Do We Achieve This?

This is achieved through collaborating with leading academics in the field of Australian Intellectual Property Law, curating and creating a textbook which is accessible. The open textbook is free to access and use and the content is provided in a variety of formats- written in plain english, detailed case notes, information tables, infographics and video explainers.

### Content and Collaboration

This open textbook has been created through collaboration. The open textbook was curated and edited by Associate Professor Nicolas Suzor, Dr Kylie Pappalardo and Jessica Stevens. There is a full list of collaborators at the bottom of this page -without the collaborators this open textbook would not have been possible.
