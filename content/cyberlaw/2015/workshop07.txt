# Week 7: Critical thinking and policy assignment preparation

We have dedicated this week to help you write better policy submissions and understand the policy arguments that are made in relation to internet regulation. We have built in a whole week to focus on the skills of critical analysis and argumentation. This is directly relevant to your assessment: your assignment will be marked based primarily on your ability to carefully construct a persuasive argument. You will need to weigh the different policy implications in order to come to an evaluation of the best way to proceed. This will require not only a significant research component, but also a detailed critical analysis of the likely effects of the proposed policy.

In order to help you develop these skills, we have prescribed a series of videos on critical analysis this week. We will also be dedicating one hour of the workshop to discussing the contours of the assignment problem. In the second hour of the workshop, we will review your in-progress executive summary. This is a vital opportunity for formative feedback before the assessment is due; using this summary, we will show you how to ensure that your argument is well supported and well-scoped. In order to benefit from this opportunity, you must email us your draft executive summary by Sunday 30 August.

## Executive summaries

An executive summary should clearly present your argument. It should be no longer than one page and should be completely self-contained. This means the reader must be able to understand the key recommendations you make, and the bases upon which you make them, from this summary. It should be designed so that an executive can make an informed decision about the policy issues without reading the detail contained in the rest of the document. 

In policy writing, an executive summary is not a summary of the problem or what your submission will cover. It is a summary of the key recommendations you make and the arguments you use to justify those recommendations. Think of your audience as the Government Minister or Head of Department responsible for the policy. Do not include an explanation of the problem or the law; you can assume that the Minister is well aware of these details. Do not waste their time; they just want to know and understand your argument.
