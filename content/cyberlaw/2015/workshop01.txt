### Exercise 1: Key terms and concepts

1. What did you make of John Perry Barlow's Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace? Do you accept the argument that Governments shouldn't interfere with how the internet is governed? Explain why.

2. Some people believe that internet access is a human right. Do you think it is? How important is the internet to daily life in modern society?

3. How well has Barlow's claim that the internet is unregulable stood up over the last twenty years?


### Exercise 2: Internet trivia

Your table is competing for all the Chupa Chups in the room. Good luck!


### Exercise 3:  Regulating the internet

Your table is a practice group representing {Facebook, an anti-abuse advocacy group, or a civil libertarian organisation}. You are twenty minutes away from a negotiation meeting, mediated by the Australian Department of Online Law Enforcement. The Australian Government is very keen to do something to reduce the amount of hate speech, particularly gender-based hate speech, on the internet. Prepare your list of talking points for the meeting.
