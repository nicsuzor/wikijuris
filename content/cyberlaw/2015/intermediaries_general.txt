## Workshop questions

### 1. Discussion: Goldsmith & Wu's article. 

To what extent does this article convincingly rebuff the arguments made by John Perry Barlow and Johnson & Post that we studied in Week 1?

Some points of discussion:

* A borderless internet. To what extent does the internet we know reflect geography? Is this good?
* "Information wants to be free'. What are the value-laden assumptions made here? Do we agree with them?
* "We now risk a race to the bottom," predicted Alan Davidson of the Center for Democracy and Technology, in which "the most restrictive rules about Internet content—influenced by any country—could have an impact on people around the world." Has this fear been borne out?
* Why did Yahoo capitulate?
* Is it good that Yahoo capitulates to France? What about to China?


Go back to Barlow's claims:

1. The internet is unregulable. What's Goldsmith & Wu's answer?

2. The internet should not be regulated by territorial governments. What do Goldsmith & Wu say?



### 2. Regulating users

1. What is the theoretical justification for imposing liability on intermediaries for the acts of their users?

2. What can go wrong when intermediaries are legally liable for posts made by others?

3. How can the law protect users against fraudulent or incorrect complaints made by third parties to intermediaries?



### 3. Group work: regulating hate speech online

Your table is a practice group representing {Facebook, an anti-abuse advocacy group, or a civil libertarian organisation}. You are twenty minutes away from a negotiation meeting, mediated by the Australian Department of Online Law Enforcement. The Australian Government is very keen to do something to reduce the amount of hate speech, particularly gender-based hate speech, on the internet. 

The last meeting did not go very well - we barely got through opening remarks. The Government has called a follow-up. The Attorney-General's department is clearly not impressed with the attitude of US-based social network companies that they will set and enforce their own content standards.

In particular, the government points to the recent issues faced by Clementine Ford, who was banned from Facebook after naming and shaming some of the people who had sent her graphic abuse. See, e.g.:

Prepare your list of talking points for the meeting.
