## Discussion topics

1. How do you feel about the Federal government knowing virtually everything about your financial, health, and relationship life?  How do you feel about Facebook (and their advertising partners) knowing the same information?

2. How do you feel about the US government (in conjunction with the Australian) knowing what you write in personal correspondence?

3. How much would you have to be paid to disclose your creditworthiness to a person in the street? How much are you actually paid to disclose this? 

4. Do we need a Right to be Forgotten in Australia?

5. Data retention laws: has a compromise been reached?


## Workshop questions

Peter Lee runs a small Chinese restaurant in Newcastle, called Chinatown. His annual turnover is AUD 2,7mln. Peter Lee has introduced a lottery game. His customers are asked to fill in a customer satisfaction survey. Every month one of the customers wins a prize, a travel voucher coupon, from a Chinese travel agency China Dragon, a company registered in and operating from China.  In the questionnaire customers are requested to indicate their name, marital status, profession and income range, postal address, email and a telephone number. The questionnaire does not mention for which purpose this data will be used. 

Peter Lee has a contract with China Dragon where Peter Lee committed to transfer them all filled-in questionnaires. In turn, China Dragon committed to give one travel voucher for every monthly winner. In the contract China Dragon is obliged to use the personal information they receive in compliance with the Australian Privacy Act 1988. 

One of the customers Alina Bates who filled in the questionnaire started receiving constant communication from the China Dragon about their services, both per post and per email. She complained with the OAIC arguing that Peter Lee and China Dragon have misused her personal information.

Advice Peter Lee and China Dragon. Is there is anything they could do to avoid the violation of Australian Privacy laws?
