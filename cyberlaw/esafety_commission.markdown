The _Enhancing Online Safety for Children Act 2015_ created the independent Office of the Children’s eSafety Commissioner.[^safety14] The Commissioner enforces the 2-tiered scheme as provided for by the Act, which exists for “the rapid removal from social media services of cyber-bullying material targeted at an Australian child.”[^safety20] “Cyber-bullying material targeted at an Australian child” is held to the standard of whether a reasonable person would think that it was directed towards an Australian child and whether it would be “seriously threatening, seriously intimidating, seriously harassing or seriously humiliating the Australian child.”[^safety5]

Parliament stated their intentions that they expect “each social media service will comply with the basic online safety requirements.”[^safety22]  The system affects the behaviour of end-users both directly and through intermediaries (social media sites). Social media services are affected on a two tier system, with the essential difference in enforcement being that tier 2 services may have action taken against them by the Commissioner.[^rozario] The Act also may be used to target end-users who are deemed to have targeted an Australian child with cyber-bullying material through the use of an end-user notice with a number of consequences including removal of the material, refraining from posting such material and apologising.[^safety41]
