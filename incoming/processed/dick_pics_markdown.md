### Example: Unsolicited Dick Pics

An illustrative example of how existing harassment laws struggle with digital contexts is the sending of unsolicited sexual images, commonly known as "dick pics." It's important to distinguish this from consensual sexting, which is a normal part of many adults' digital relationships and sexual expression. The legal issue arises specifically when intimate images are sent without consent or solicitation.

Research from dating applications like Bumble found that 41% of women have received unsolicited photographs of male genitalia. The 2023 [Online Safety Issues Survey](https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/department/media/publications/2023-online-safety-issues-survey-summary-report) found that nearly 8% of respondents had experienced this behaviour in the past 12 months, with women and LGBTQIA+ people disproportionately affected.

Several jurisdictions have created specific offences for this behaviour. The UK's *Online Safety Act 2023* criminalises sending photographs of genitals with intent to cause alarm, distress or humiliation (maximum two years imprisonment). Ireland's *Online Safety and Media Regulation Act 2022* takes a similar approach.

In Australia, this conduct is not specifically criminalised. Traditional "indecent exposure" laws like section 5 of the *Summary Offences Act 1988* (NSW) are limited to public places and don't capture digital sending. The federal provision most likely to apply is section 474.14 of the *Criminal Code Act 1995* (Cth), which criminalises using carriage services to menace, harass or cause offence, but this requires proving the conduct would be considered menacing, harassing or offensive by a reasonable person.[^2]

Some state laws may apply in specific circumstances. Victoria's *Crimes Act 1958* section 48 creates an offence for sexual activity directed toward another person intending to cause fear or distress, though how courts would interpret this in digital contexts remains unclear.

This example illustrates how laws designed for physical spaces often translate poorly to digital environments, creating enforcement gaps even for relatively straightforward harmful conduct.
