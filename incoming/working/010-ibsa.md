**Image-based abuse**

**5.1.1 Introduction**

Image-based abuse (also known as "revenge porn") refers to the
distribution of intimate materials without a person's consent. This can
occur in both image and video formats. An intimate image is 'an image
showing someone\'s private parts, or a person involved in a private
activity, in situations where a reasonable individual would expect
privacy' (s 15, *Online Safety Act 2021* (Cth)). Image-based abuse can
be distributed to public sites such as social media platforms or private
sites such as image boards, deep web sites or closed community pages.
Due to the digital footprint left behind, the internet not only
facilitates quick distribution and sharing but also establishes an
unchangeable and permanent record of every action made behind a screen.

**5.1.2 Legal context**

*5.1.2.1 Regulation for individuals*

In 2016, there was a [senate
inquiry](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Legal_and_Constitutional_Affairs/Revenge_porn)
that called for image-based abuse to be criminalised at federal level.
This was shortly followed with the passing of *Criminal Code Amendment
(Protecting Minors Online) Bill 2017* (Cth) and the *Enhancing Online
Safety (Non-Consensual Sharing of Intimate Images) Act* 2018 (Cth) which
amended the *Criminal Code Act 1995* (Cth), making it an offence for an
adult to use a device to *\"*prepare or plan to cause harm to, procure,
or engage in sexual activity with, a person under the age of 16 (a
child)\".

In 2017, the Australian Government released the [National Statement of
Principles relating to the criminalisation of the non-consensual sharing
of intimate
images](https://www.ag.gov.au/crime/publications/national-statement-principles-relating-criminalisation-non-consensual-sharing-intimate-images).
It called on each state and territory to consider the existing legal
scheme (law and policy), and to develop and review it in accordance with
the principles such as;

-   The threat to and/or distribution of images without consent is a
    breach of community standards;

-   The prioritisation of the safety of victims is paramount;

-   The response to image-based abuse may include criminal charges,
    civil penalties, education and awareness; and

-   Responding to image abuse needs to account for all methods and
    circumstances in how it may be distributed.

See the full list of principles
[here](https://www.ag.gov.au/crime/publications/national-statement-principles-relatingcriminalisation-).

Since then, Australia has seen the introduction of the *Online Safety
Act 2021* (Cth) which makes it an offence to threaten and/or distribute
intimate images without a person's consent. A summary of the charges
applicable to image-based abuse both at the federal level and in New
South Wales are depicted in the table below (not exhaustive):

Section 474.17 of the *Criminal Code Act 1995* (Cth) has seen multiple
perpetrators convicted of using the internet to harass individuals.[^1]

*5.1.2.2 Regulation for social media platforms*

*The Online Safety Act 2021* (Cth) has introduced basic online safety
expectations (**'BOSE'**) for online service providers requiring them to
take reasonable steps to minimise the risk of harm. These include:

> • Technological precautions are in place to ensure access to
> age-appropriate material;
>
> • Ensuring that there is a sufficient reports and complaints process
> for material that breaches the OSP's terms and conditions as well as
> the act; and
>
> • Complaints and removal notices issued by the eSafety Commissioner
> are removed within 30 days (s 46, Online Safety Act 2021 (Cth)).

In 2021, the High Court found that the moderators of public social media
pages may be found liable for defamatory content that is published by
users.[^2] Additionally, if this is reported to the eSafety
commissioner, the commissioner can issue a breach notice where a social
media platform has 24 hours to remove the content, or they may be
penalised up to \$550,000 (s 77, Online Safety Act 2021 (Cth)).

**5.1.3 Social context**

*5.1.3.1 Key statistics*

The prevalence of image-based abuse was highlighted in a study conducted
by the eSafety commissioner in 2017 that found that 1 in 10 individuals
experienced image-based abuse, with females aged between 15 to 17 years
being most at risk. The report also found the following:

• 6 in 10 victims knew the perpetrator;

> • The perpetrator was a friend that they knew offline (29%), an
> ex-partner (13%), a current partner (12%) or a family member (10%);
> and

• Image-based abuse is more likely to occur on Facebook (53%).[^3]

*5.1.3.2 Factors affecting image-based abuse*

The eSafety commissioner is empowered to investigate and make decisions
regarding image-based abuse but this requires victims to report it.
Studies have estimated that only 35% of cases of image-based abuse are
reported.[^4] The factors influencing a victim not reporting can
include;

• Negative stigma;

> • Psychological barriers including victim blaming, humiliation and
> embarrassment;

• An unawareness of the severity of the incident;

> • A fear of exacerbating or making it worse including attention to
> image-based abuse;

• Lack of confidence in law enforcement; and

• Unaware of the support services available.

*5.1.3.3 Social prevention and response from key stakeholders*

Considering the social context of image-based abuse, there have been
several actions taken by the Australian Government and other bodies to
raise awareness and better educate individuals to make more appropriate
choices online. These are summarised below;

1.  The Office of the eSafety Commissioner has developed a professional
    learning program for teachers and facilitators titled *'*Online
    Harmful Sexual Behaviours, Misinformation and Emerging
    Technology*'.* Its goal is to equip individuals with the necessary
    skills to identify and respond to incidences of image-based abuse
    and the role that coercion plays.

More information about the program can be accessed
[here](https://www.nsw.gov.au/education-and-training/cybermarvel/professional-learning/cyber-security-secondary).

2.  In 2020, the NSW Government launched a campaign to help prevent
    image-based abuse and educate individuals on the topic including
    information on where to seek help. This was largely due to the
    number of reports between 2019 to 2020, namely a 172% increase. [^5]
    The campaign also offered counselling to individuals and the removal
    of the content.

3.  In 2022, the Australian Government responded to the report from the
    Senate titled '*Phenomenon colloquially referred to as 'revenge
    porn''.* The statement supported most of the recommendations
    proposed including that all police officers undertake mandatory
    training around image-based abuse.

The responses from online service providers to the issue of image-based
abuse are highlighted below;

1.  In February 2015, Reddit updated its private policy to prohibit the
    publication of image-based abuse;[^6]

2.  In March 2015, Twitter (now known as 'X') announced that they would
    immediately remove any link image-based abuse upon request;[^7] and

3.  In June/July 2015, Google and Microsoft announced they would remove
    links upon request.[^8]
