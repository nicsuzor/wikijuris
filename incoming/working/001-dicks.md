### Example: Unsolicited Dick Pics

*[Video overview](https://youtu.be/FGEf4AZeiss) by Kaito Suzuki*

An illustrative example of how existing harassment laws struggle with digital contexts is the sending of unsolicited sexual images, commonly known as "dick pics." It's important to distinguish this from consensual sexting, which is a normal part of many adults' digital relationships and sexual expression. The legal issue arises specifically when intimate images are sent without consent or solicitation.

**Editor's note**: not sure about the neologism...

Domestically, the 2023 [Online Safety Issues Survey](https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/department/media/publications/2023-online-safety-issues-survey-summary-report)
found that nearly 8% of those surveyed had experienced cyber-flashing in the last 12 months. Similarly, this survey found experiences of
cyber-flashing were predominately women and people who identify as
LGBTQIA+. Research from dating applications like Bumble found that 41% of women have received unsolicited photographs of male genitalia. The 2023 [Online Safety Issues Survey](https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/department/media/publications/2023-online-safety-issues-survey-summary-report) found that nearly 8% of respondents had experienced this behaviour in the past 12 months, with women and LGBTQIA+ people disproportionately affected.

Several jurisdictions have created specific offences for this behaviour. The UK's *Online Safety Act 2023* criminalises sending photographs of genitals with intent to cause alarm, distress or humiliation (maximum two years imprisonment). Ireland's *Online Safety and Media Regulation Act 2022* takes a similar approach.

In Australia, this conduct is not specifically criminalised. Traditional "indecent exposure" laws like section 5 of the *Summary Offences Act 1988* (NSW) are limited to public places and don't capture digital sending. The federal provision most likely to apply is section 474.14 of the *Criminal Code Act 1995* (Cth), which criminalises using carriage services to menace, harass or cause offence, but this requires proving the conduct would be considered menacing, harassing or offensive by a reasonable person.[^2] 

Some state laws may apply in specific circumstances. Victoria's *Crimes Act 1958* section 48 creates an offence for sexual activity directed toward another person intending to cause fear or distress, though how courts would interpret this in digital contexts remains unclear.

This example illustrates how laws designed for physical spaces often translate poorly to digital environments, creating enforcement gaps even for relatively straightforward harmful conduct.


**Cyber-flashing: international approaches**

The United Kingdom's *Online Safety Act 2023* created a criminal offence
for a person sending photographs or films of their genitals to intend to
cause alarm, distress or humiliation. It carries a prison sentence of up
to 2 years.

In Ireland, the *Online Safety and Media Regulation Act 2022*
criminalises the act of exposing one's genitals online with the intent
to cause fear, distress, or alarm to others.

Other countries such as Singapore, Scotland and some parts of the United
States have also developed law reforms in response to the issue of
cyber-flashing. Information on each country's response to cyber-flashing
can be found
[here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022018320972306).

**Australia's approach**

In Australia, cyber-flashing is not specifically addressed or regulated
in any legislation, including the *Online Safety Act 2021* (Cth). A
single instance of cyber-flashing is not explicitly criminalised unless
the victim is under 18, in which case it may be considered as sending
child exploitation material.

The most relevant Commonwealth legal provision that applies to
cyber-flashing in Australia is found in section 474.14 of the *Criminal
Code Act 1995* (Cth). This provision criminalises the use of carriage
services (such as the internet) to menace, harass, or cause offence,
carrying a maximum penalty of three years' imprisonment. The offence
applies if a reasonable person would consider the conduct as menacing,
harassing, or offensive. However, this offence usually applies where
someone uses equipment connected to a telecommunications network in the
commission of, or to facilitate the commission of, a serious
offence.[^1]

The states also have criminal law provisions that may capture
cyber-flashing.

- "Indecent or obscene exposure" is addressed under section 5 of the
*Summary Offences Act 1988* (NSW) which carries a maximum of 10 units
(fine) or six months' imprisonment. However, cyber-flashing does not
fall under this category as a summary offence. The offence of indecent
exposure is specifically for public places, and while an unsolicited
"dick pic" would constitute indecent exposure, the definition of public
place under the Act does not extend to online communication.

-   In Victoria, section 48 of the *Crimes Act 1958* (Vic) imposes an
    offence if a person engages in sexual activity directed to another
    person intending for that person to experience fear or distress from
    seeing the activity. However, the legality of this section in
    applying to cyber-flashing would depend on the context of the image
    and how courts interpret the specifics of an activity.

-   In South Australia, section 53 of the *Summary Offences Act* 1953
    (SA) creates a summary offence to behave in an indecent manner in a
    public place or in a place visible from a public place, or in any
    place with the intent to offend or insult another person. Whilst
    this does open the interpretation more than that of the Commonwealth
    law, the application of this in the digital space is still limiting.
    As cyber-flashing does not occur in a public place, the application
    of this offence to cases of unsolicited explicit images is unclear.
