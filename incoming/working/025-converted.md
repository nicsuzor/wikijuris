**4b NSW Legislation**

In New South Wales, cyberstalking offences are provided for under
section 13 of the *Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act* *2007*
(NSW) (**'CDVP'**), as they are often found to relate to "stalking or
intimidation with the intent to cause fear of physical or mental
harm",[^2] and section 7 of the *Online Safety Act 2021* (Cth)
(**'OSA'**). An offence under section 13 of the CDVP may also need to
satisfy the provisions or definitions under the OSA to succeed in court.
