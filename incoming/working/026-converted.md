**5 Decentralised Networks & Internet Governance**

The internet was initially decentralised to facilitate an equal and
transparent interchange of information. However, recently there has been
a concentration of power in the hands of a small number of large
corporations. This raises concerns around accountability because
centralised networks concentrate data ownership, meaning there is a
greater chance of widespread data breaches and privacy violations. In
response, decentralised networks are gaining popularity once more,
highlighting new opportunities for regulation outside (or complementary
to) the formal law.

**What is a decentralised network?**

A decentralised network distributes information processing across
multiple machines. Each computing device acts as a separate processor
that interacts with all the other devices in the network. This contrasts
with a centralised network, which is a single computer that handles all
computing for a network. A decentralised structure enhances security,
reduces the risk of systemic failures, and promotes transparency.

Computing devices today have significant computing power. Decentralised
networks take advantage of this computing capability and pair it with
networking technology that can help devices quickly interact with each
other and coordinate activity. Some decentralised networks may still
rely on a central computing infrastructure for things like data storage.
However, a fully distributed and decentralised network has no singular
computing unit controlling any process.

**Governance of Decentralised Networks**

1.  **Decentralised Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)**: DAOs are a prime
    example of decentralised governance. They use blockchain technology
    and smart contracts to automate decision-making processes, allowing
    for democratic participation without the need for a central
    authority. Members of a DAO can vote on proposals and changes,
    ensuring that governance is transparent and community-driven based
    in the geographical location. This enhances compliance with local
    laws.

2.  **Collaborative and regulatory decision-making**: In decentralised
    networks, decisions are made collaboratively by the network
    participants. This can involve voting mechanisms, consensus
    algorithms, or other methods that ensure that the voices of a wide
    variety of stakeholders are heard.

3.  **Modularity**: Decentralised governance often involves modular
    structures, where different parts of the network can operate
    semi-independently by smaller groups or individuals. This allows for
    flexibility and adaptability in governance, and enhanced oversight.
