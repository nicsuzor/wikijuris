**AI and Copyright**

**Overview**

**Source code as a copyright work**

Under the *Copyright Act 1968* (Cth), computer programs are recognised
as literary work.[^1] A computer program is defined as 'a set of
statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a
computer in order to bring about a certain result'.[^2] Under this
definition, the source code of artificial intelligence technology is a
literary work where the other subsistence criteria are met.[^3]

**A 'Qualified Person'**

For copyright to subsist in relation to work under the *Copyright Act
1968* (Cth) the work must be authored by a qualified person, being 'an
Australian citizen or a person resident in Australia'.[^4] This
disqualifies artificial intelligence from holding the status of an
author.

**Originality**

Where a human being uses an AI tool or program to create or enhance the
creation of an original work, the issue will turn to originality, where
the test formulated in *IceTV Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd*
is relevant.[^5] Is the work the product of sufficient independent
intellectual effort of a literary nature?

> "Where a literary work is brought into such existence by the efforts
> of more than one individual, it will be a question of fact and degree
> which one or more of them have expended sufficient effort of a
> literary nature to be considered an author of that work within the
> meaning of the Act" (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ, \[99\]).

**Copyright infringement litigation**

Generative artificial intelligence collects information from a variety
of sources to train its model, which has consequently led to frequent
occurrences of GenAI being trained on copyrighted works. This has led to
much litigation surrounding copyright infringement, as exemplified by US
cases such as [Image Generator
Litigation](https://imagegeneratorlitigation.com/) and [Github Copilot
litigation](https://githubcopilotlitigation.com/).
