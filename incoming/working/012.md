### Debate: Protecting online safety vs freedom of speech/expression

The expanded powers of the eSafety Commissioner under the _Online Safety Act 2021_ (Cth) have sparked significant debate around the balance between ensuring online safety and protecting the freedom of speech and expression. Advocates argue that these powers are crucial for combatting the increasing occurrence of harmful online content, including cyberbullying, image-based abuse and violent material. They believe that the measures and powers under the Commissioner are essential to protect the vulnerable individuals, particularly children from severe harm.

However, critics express concerns that the Commissioner's expanded authority could infringe on freedom of expression and speech through censorship and overreach. They argue that the Act lacks sufficient safeguards to prevent the wrongful removal of legitimate content such as satire or other material that might be misclassified as harmful. For example, the restrictions on material classified under Class 2 materials including lawful content such as R18+ and X18+ content could unnecessarily interfere with sexual health information, education resources and the rights of sex workers to express themselves and conduct their work, which limits their expression.

#### Learning Activity: Analysing the Balance between Online Safety and Freedom of Speech

This learning activity is aimed to deepen the understanding of these diverse perspectives and developing critical thinking skills.

**Instructions:**

1. Read and review the _Online Safety Act 2021_ (Cth) and reflect on how the powers granted to the Commissioner might affect both safety and suppression of free speech and expression.

2. Research two real-world examples where online safety measures effectively protected individuals or where measures lead to concerns about freedom of speech and expression. Consider Australian cases and international cases.

3. Write a post for your online course's discussion forum regarding whether the current powers of the commissioner are effective in balancing freedom of speech and expression while protecting individuals. Include your research in your analysis.
   
   a. Consider: Are powers too broad? Do they allow free speech/expression? Could the powers be improved?

4. Engage in a peer's discussion post and provide feedback on their arguments and clarity.

This activity can be adapted for in-person debate where students pick a side of the argument and debate each other on their research and written discussion.
