### United Kingdom

The United Kingdom's Online Safety Act 2023 represents a comprehensive approach to platform regulation that extends beyond Australia's co-regulatory model. The Act imposes direct duties on social media platforms and search engines to protect users from harmful content. The Office of Communications (Ofcom) is implementing the Act through codes of practice addressing illegal content, content harmful to children, and specific categorised services.[^1]

The UK Act introduces several new criminal offences that address gaps in existing law:

- **Intimate image abuse** (s 188) - criminalising the non-consensual sharing of intimate images, similar to Australia's image-based abuse provisions
- **Epilepsy trolling** (s 183) - targeting those who send content designed to trigger seizures
- **False communications** (s 179) - prohibiting the sending of false information intended to cause non-trivial harm
- **Threatening communications** (s 181) - modernising threats law for digital contexts
- **Encouraging self-harm** (s 184) - addressing content that encourages or assists serious self-harm
- **Cyberflashing** (s 187) - criminalising the unsolicited sending of sexual images

These offences demonstrate how jurisdictions are identifying and addressing specific online harms through targeted criminal law provisions, complementing broader platform regulation approaches.

### Canada

Canada's proposed Online Harms Bill 2024 takes a duty-based approach to platform regulation.[^2] The Bill would impose three primary duties on social media services:

1. **Duty to act responsibly** - requiring platforms to implement systems to address harmful content
2. **Duty to protect children** - specific obligations regarding content accessible to minors
3. **Duty to make certain content inaccessible**, specifically:
   - Content that sexually victimises a child or revictimises a survivor
   - Intimate images posted without consent

This approach emphasises proactive obligations on platforms rather than reactive content removal, reflecting an emerging trend in online safety regulation.[^3]
